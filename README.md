# A Rust-flavoured 6-Channel Pololu Micro Maestro API Interface
Written and developed by UBC Bionics, Ltd., a design team based in the University of British Columbia, Vancouver.

## Getting Started
The Rust crate "rppal" provides user-level APIs for protocols such as PWM, I2C, and UART.
In order to configure UART for the Raspberry Pi, do the following:
1. Remove "console=serial0,11520" from /boot/cmdline.txt
2. Disable the Bluetooth by:
	* Adding "dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt" to /boot/config.txt (without the quotation marks)
		* For the RPi4 models, add "dtoverlay=disable-bt" instead
		* Once this is done, reboot the Pi (by powering it off and then on again)
		* Connecting GPIO Pin-14 (physical pin 08) to an LED, this LED should be LIT
	* Running the command "sudo systemctl disable hciuart"

### Trouble-shooting
If "cargo build" or "cargo test" do not work because of the rppal dependency, check the rppal documentations on how to set up UART.
The link is [here][1].

## Set-Up
1. Connect the power+ground lines from the RPi to the Maestro.
2. Connect the RPI's TX and RX pins to the Maestro's RX and TX pins, respectively. Please note the order in which the pins need to be connected (RPi TX connected to Maestro RX; RPi RX connected to Maestro TX).
3. Connect the power lines for the servos (holding the board such that the pins are facing you and are on the right side of the board,these are the 2 pins on the top right). The left one of the pair is the power; the right one is ground.
4. Connect up to 6 servos on one of the pin-triples available (the backside of the board has more info on each pin-type).

## Usage
In order to send commands to the Micro Maestro:
1. Create a new Maestro struct instance.
2. Initialize the instance by:
	* Calling the start method with a baudrate.
	* Matching off of the std::result::Result returned.
3. Call one of the methods listed in the MaestroCommands trait with the appropriate arguments.
	* The 6-Channel Micro Maestro is able to service 6 servo motors. A channel can be selected through the rustro::maestro_constants::Channels enum.
